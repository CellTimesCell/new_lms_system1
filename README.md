LMS System - Comprehensive Project Overview
Project Summary
This Learning Management System (LMS) is a modern educational platform built with a microservices architecture, designed to provide more detailed student activity tracking and flexible course management compared to traditional platforms like Canvas and Blackboard. The system supports multiple languages (English and Spanish) and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Components
Backend (Python/FastAPI)

Core API: Provides RESTful endpoints for users, courses, assignments, and grading
Analytics Service: Tracks and analyzes student activity (page views, time spent, etc.)
Content Service: Manages file storage for course materials and submissions
Notification Service: Handles email notifications and alerts
AI Service: Provides auto-grading and plagiarism detection capabilities

Frontend (React)

Student Dashboard: Shows enrolled courses, upcoming assignments, and progress
Instructor Dashboard: Provides analytics on student engagement and tools for course management
Admin Panel: For system-wide management and configuration
Course Pages: Display course content, modules, and assignments
Assignment Submission: Interface for submitting and viewing assignment feedback

Database Structure

Users: Authentication and profile information
Roles: Role-based access control (admin, instructor, student)
Courses: Course details and configuration
Modules: Course content organization
Assignments: Tasks for students to complete
Submissions: Student work submitted for assignments
Grades: Assessment scores and feedback
ActivityEvents: Detailed tracking of student interactions

alembic upgrade head

Start core services:
# In separate terminals
cd core
uvicorn lms_core.main:app --reload --port 8000

cd microservices/analytics_service
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001

Start frontend:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start


Docker Development
docker-compose up -d
Testing

Unit tests in the tests/ directory
Run with pytest: python -m pytest
